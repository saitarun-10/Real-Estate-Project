# Project Title: Gurgaon Real Estate Insight Hub
This project leverages data science techniques to provide insights, predictions, and recommendations in the real estate domain. It encompasses data gathering, cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, and deployment of a user-friendly application.

Key Phases:
1. Data Gathering:
Self-scraped real estate data from the 99acres website.

2. Data Cleaning & Merging:
Handled missing values and ensured consistency by merging data on houses and flats.

3. Feature Engineering:
Enhanced the dataset with additional features like room indicators, possession age, furnishing details, and luxury scores.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted univariate and multivariate analyses to uncover data patterns, using Pandas Profiling for deeper insights.

5. Outlier Detection & Missing Value Imputation:
Identified and removed outliers and applied imputation techniques for missing values in key columns.

6. Feature Selection:
Employed various techniques (correlation analysis, SHAP, LASSO) to identify impactful variables for modeling.

7. Model Selection & Productionalization:
Compared multiple regression models (Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest, MLP, LASSO, Ridge, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, KNN, ElasticNet) based on accuracy and generalization. Deployed the best model through Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for price predictions.

8. Analytics Module:
Developed visual representations (geographical maps, word clouds, scatter plots) for key insights into the real estate market.

9. Recommender System:
Built three models focusing on top facilities, price details, and location advantages, offering personalized recommendations through an intuitive interface.

10. Insights Module:
Created an insights module to summarize key findings and trends, enhancing user understanding and decision-making in the real estate market.

This project showcases expertise in feature engineering, EDA, cross-validation, and model building, along with practical deployment, making valuable insights accessible to users.
